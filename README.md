# Valheim Prop Hunt (Greyling Hunt)

A work in progress mod, currently in very early alpha.

Inspired by older mods in Counter Strike and Garry's Mod comes a Prop Hunt in Valheim! 
Players on the server are divided into hiders and seekers. They then take turns hiding and searching.

**Currently only turning into different props is synced and initial gameplay setup (waiting for players, setup, hider and seeker distribution)**

**DO NOT USE your main Character or Worlds for now, if you do make a backup first**

## Controls
* Numpad 5 to make a random sound
* Numpad 6 to scroll between different props

## Gameplay
* Hiders are able to turn into multiple objects that are available in the game (even NPCs!).
* Seekers take damage if they hit an object which is not a hider.
* Hiders that are staying too long in one place will start burping and laughing.
* Size of the map and biome will be configurable.
* Seekers will have specific loadout to help them find the hiders.
* In the future player inventories of existing characters will be saved and restored at the end of the game, or when they leave.

# Installation
